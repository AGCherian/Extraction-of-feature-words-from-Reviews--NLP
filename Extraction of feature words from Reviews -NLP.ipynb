            "below is the experience so far.1. received a defective product. battery was getting drained out in few hours, wifi kept getting disconnected and almost every app was giving trouble,  including google maps. (location was not getting captured)2. tried to return it on the 8th day of purchase after running into issues with every app i open. (tried on 7th night as well, but phone froze and was not able to even switch off and restart the mobile - amazon app was in this phone. used another phone to check how to force reboot next morning and switched on the mobile)3. amazon said return window is closed on 7th night and now i need to call samsung customer care directly for replacement.4. called samsung customer care and they tried to check the phone remotely - couldnt identify the issue.5. informed i will have to visit the samsung service center to figure out the issue6. first visit to center, they did a software update (3 week old phone now - not sure what update would be pending) and returned the phone saying we will see if issue persist for one more week. they also whipped out the entire apps in the phone.7. faced issues the very same evening, lived with it for one more day and went back next morning.8. second visit, they identified that both motherboard and battery had manufacturing defect and will have to be replaced.9. i requested for a phone replacement and they told me their policy doesn't allow them to replace the device and can only replace the mother board and battery, which was defective11. they told me i will have to contact samsung customer case number again if i want a product replacement as they don't have the authority for that.10. called customer care number again, and they inform me i have to contact amazon for product replacement as amazon was the seller.so back to step 3. will have to see how many more hoops need to be jumped to reach the end , if i manage to reach there.update :11. all customer care said they can't replace the phone. so surrendered to defeat and gave the phone back to samsung customer care center for battery and mother board replacement. they gave back the phone next day saying parts are replaced. again, whipped out of the apps which i had downloaded and logged in again.12. i checked the phone from the center itself before taking it back and i figured the problem still persist (battery was draining out by the minute). i showed it to them. they told me it's a new battery and will take some time to stabilize. they also asked me to buy a super fast charger, while i bought from them to not take chances. they asked me to check for 2 days and confirm. used for 2 days. same situation. no improvement.13. went back to them again. they checked and said they will forward it to technical team for checking now.14. technical team checked the device and said there was a software issue for few products in this version and then will need a 4 days to correct it since they are still working on the software update to correct this. i have no idea how this product passed the quality test if all these statements which they are making are true.15. by this time samsung customer care has used the phone for more days than me since buying the device and they have identified hardware issue and software issue in the product, but still refuse to give the money back and take back the product inspite of repeated requests.15. they kept the phone for 5 days and returned saying everything is fixed.16. phone started functioning normally finally but i was sick and tired of the experience.17. i called the samsung corporate customer care narating the the whole series of event and asking for refund. they refused with all their might and said \"phone is working now\". during the process i also figured out that the customer care center who kept the phone for 5 days for repair dint even create a registered complaint or a job code while holding the phone for 5 days. i officially registered a complaint. but still no luck of returning the phone.update on nov 30th.18. i was traveling and outside the country. on nov 21st while using the phone and with 70% charge left screen went off and stared showing grid lines like some tv from 1980's. tried switching of the mobile and restarting multiple times. no luck. still grid lines. my flight bookings, hotel bookings and everything one can think of, was in the mobile and my 3 month old phone is not responding to anything possible. friend thankfully had a spare mobile and i used that phone till i completed the trip.19. reached back in town yesterday and my first act is to visit samsung customer care center. (nov 30th.) am writing this update sitting at the customer care center. they mentioned \"patch issue. software update dint happen\" . at this point, i know they are just speaking rubbish to engage the customer and just delay the situation. no 3 month old phone's screen will stop responding because of software update missing. they are opening the phone again to operate it, after again refusing my request for money refund. \n",

            "this phone is worth every rupee i paid. usually what happens is i buy a phone when the existing one i have gets broken or starts seriously underperforming. thus, each and every phone i've bought in the past was a desperate buy because everybody's life just pauses without a smartphone these days.this time i knew samsung would be releasing the m53 and i was following it quite religiously. and i bought it the moment it was available for prime members a day early from the launch. this was my first experience waiting for a gadget to be launched just so i could buy it.the battery life is perfect for me as it runs for the whole day with my usage. i keep the always-on display turned on for like 9-12 hours every day. it's connected to the wifi 24 hours a day, and bluetooth is on for about 6 hours a day when the music is playing. i don't use the mobile speakers as i already have a bluetooth device for music lying around most of the time.the first thing i love is the digital wellbeing features. i have set up the bedtime mode to help me sleep and not be bothered by notifications so even at night if i wake up and start checking my phone, it notifies me that indirectly meaning that you're supposed to be asleep which is a good thing as it reminds me to put the phone down and go to sleep. i'll attach a screenshot for this.the second thing to note is the bixby routines. it's very annoying to get that \"turn on your location\" prompt whenever you open zomato, ola, zepto, rapido, sign in to paytm payments bank, or whatever app that you need to access but requires gps to operate. i use bixby routines a lot. so one of them is for this purpose only to turn on the location whenever one of such apps is opened. i'll attach screenshots. also, i would recommend you use your phone normally without these for a week or two and then set up the bixby routines, as it suggests routines based on your usage.the only bad side i can think of is the screenshot gesture. i still don't understand how it works like they say you use your palm to swipe across the screen but i don't see how that is convenient for users using a case or a cover as these things now come with bump design on the edges of the screen as well in order to protect the screen if you choose to set your phone down on a plain surface with the screen facing down.you can still use the volume rocker and the power buttons together to take the screenshot however it seems like you can not change this palm gesture to something else like a three-finger swipe-down on an oppo device. at least there should've been options to select a gesture to capture a screenshot.overall, i would say if you're switching or upgrading your phone from a lower budget smartphone that ranges from 10-15k and looking for that first phone you wanna spend on, this is a highly recommended product. \n",

            "it was an awful great indian festival'22 for me. i bundle ordered this phone along with a pathetic mattress from wakefit. the mattress got cancelled 3 days after scheduled delivery, and this phone does not even work.4 hours into using it, i was on a phone call and suddenly it makes a lot of noise that goes away on speaker mode only to return upon turning the speaker off. while still continuing with the speaker mode, the call was dropped. after repeated attempts to place the call i realized sim 1 is not recognized. i turned off and reinserted a different sim, and it still read no sim 1. there is this obnoxious heating part which i discounted in the initial few hours, but it only got worse in that limited time this phone worked.soon it started going insane, restarting every few seconds and i was tired after a long day at work. i just dropped it on my study table to go to sleep and whole night it gave a dj lighting effect while turning on and off all on its own!this is not even the worst, i contacted amazon; a technical expert says she couldn't initiate a return/refund on this product. she rechecked only to say not possible. she can only exchange the phone that too after a diagnosis by their expert who will visit me 3 days later! like i said in the first paragraph, i reminded her off my mattress that was cancelled from their end. she feels so sorry about it, but wont accept return. that's rich! they are okay with seller cancelling the delivery without informing the customer, that too after making the customer wait for 11 days. but they won't accept a return on an insane piece of crap that they call m53.i asked her to transfer the call to the team that will answer about my mattress and she did. this guy seems sensible and accepted the return in few minutes of explaining the issue. he promptly arranged for the return pick-up next day. this was the amazon india i have known for years, but now! i returned the phone after a lot of effort and currently waiting for the refund as i type this.to try a non-chinese midrange phone i have gone for this, but now i wouldn't dare to buy a samsung phone again. \n",

            "i am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the recently purchased product which is the samsung m53 5g. i am really disappointed with the phone and the service centre. i have faced plenty of problems.let me explain problems in the detail. i purchased a cell phone on 16th may 2022. it worked well for a couple of days. as i continued to use it, i found faults in the handset. firstly, it played random noise at random times at any point in time. thus, to fix it i went to the service centre. i explained everything to the service centre. they said that the latest software update would fix the problem so they took their time and updated the software. after a couple of days, new issue raised. i.e., the screen of the phone blacked out automatically. nothing seemed to work when the screen was off. this was really frustrating.i don’t understand how the new phone within 15 days of purchase can work like a faulty piece? i chose this phone over apple and oneplus after considering all the factors and it seems to be the wrong choice for me after all. the surprising thing is when i asked the centre to replace the phone as it was creating a lot of problems and i can’t every time leave my office to fix the issues they denied and said we could do it if it is within 14 days from the date of purchase. however, it was 15 days so they did not do it. i really think this is a ridiculous way of taking care of customers.my phone is in warranty (only been 15 days)!never purchase samsung phone!! terrible experiencea really frustrated customer!! \n",

            "this phone has lots of cons that still need to be upgraded. the price range should be 16000 to 20000 only.battery is average ( was draining fast even when not in use ), fingerprint is slow, display is somehow good.the most bug that i detected from samsung is that there's a call sound problem ( both on loud as well as ear ) from the day of purchase.when i was calling someone else, call sound was high, i tried to down call volume on both loudspeaker and ear speaker, but that remained same i.e. high. the call sound is not getting down, i restarted phone but still same issue. second issue was with mic, the other person on call could not hear my voice ( with focus mode on/off ) properly. every time my voice was so less to the receiver, so had to talk loudly.both these two issues were resolved automatically after 2 days ( don't know how ) for a short time. then again faced.thought that it maybe occurred with some phone's setting, therefore i called customer care from samsung. he said that you've to call amazon customer care ( the product you purchased from ).so i called to amazon customer care and told the issue, they checked and offered me to return the phone.i returned this product.also i had purchased samsung galaxy m32 5g about 9 months ago. after 7 days of software update in current month the same above mentioned problem i'm facing. however this problem was resolved temporarily when i rebooted but after 1 day again the same issue.this is so high glitch on samsung that disappointed me.i gave one star rating. \n",
